# Diagnosis_Of_Pneumonia

## Why is this study important?

Deep Learning has emerged as a powerful tool in medical imaging, showing immense promise in assisting healthcare professionals with the detection and diagnosis of pneumonia. Through the utilization of deep learning algorithms, medical images such as X-rays can be analyzed with unparalleled accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, these algorithms can aid in classifying pneumonia into different categories, facilitating appropriate treatment strategies. By training models on extensive datasets of labelled pneumonia images, deep learning algorithms can effectively distinguish between various pneumonia types, such as bacterial, viral, or fungal pneumonia. This classification capability can significantly contribute to the early detection and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

## Problem Statement

Accurate identification and classification of pneumonia are critical for effective patient management. However, manual interpretation of chest X-rays can be time-consuming and prone to subjectivity, leading to diagnostic errors and treatment delays. Hence, there is a pressing need for automated and dependable methods to detect and classify pneumonia from medical images.

## Study Aim

This study aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the TensorFlow framework for accurate detection and classification of pneumonia from chest X-rays. The CNN will be trained on a substantial dataset of labelled pneumonia images to learn distinctive patterns and features associated with different pneumonia types. The study endeavours to achieve a high level of accuracy in pneumonia detection and classification, providing a valuable tool for healthcare professionals. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance the efficiency and precision of pneumonia diagnosis, facilitating timely and targeted treatment interventions for patients.
